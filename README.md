## Homework Assignment

### Smart Home Library Starter Project

### üéØ Goal

Create a starter implementation of a ‚ÄúSmart Home‚Äù library, along with a simple example demonstrating its functionality.

‚∏ª‚∏ª‚∏ª‚∏ª‚∏ª‚∏ª‚∏ª‚∏ª‚∏ª‚∏ª‚∏ª‚∏ª‚∏ª‚∏ª‚∏ª‚∏ª‚∏ª‚∏ª

###  üì¶ Project Structure

The library and its usage example are implemented within a single Cargo package:
	‚Ä¢	The library is implemented as a lib crate.
	‚Ä¢	The example is implemented as a bin crate.

‚∏ª‚∏ª‚∏ª‚∏ª‚∏ª‚∏ª‚∏ª‚∏ª‚∏ª‚∏ª‚∏ª‚∏ª‚∏ª‚∏ª‚∏ª‚∏ª‚∏ª‚∏ª

### üß© Library Requirements

1. Smart Thermometer

Implement a type representing a smart thermometer. It should provide:
	‚Ä¢	A constructor that accepts initial field values.
	‚Ä¢	A method to return the current temperature (use an arbitrary number).

‚∏ª‚∏ª‚∏ª‚∏ª‚∏ª‚∏ª‚∏ª‚∏ª‚∏ª‚∏ª‚∏ª‚∏ª‚∏ª‚∏ª‚∏ª‚∏ª‚∏ª‚∏ª

2. Smart Outlet

Implement a type representing a smart power outlet. It should provide:
	‚Ä¢	A constructor that accepts initial field values.
	‚Ä¢	Methods to turn the outlet on/off.
	‚Ä¢	A method to query current state (on or off).
	‚Ä¢	A method to return the current power usage:
	‚Ä¢	If off ‚Üí returns 0.
	‚Ä¢	If on ‚Üí returns an arbitrary number.

3. Smart Device

Implement an enum or struct that contains either a smart thermometer or a smart outlet, and provides:
	‚Ä¢	A method to print the state of the device to standard output.

‚∏ª‚∏ª‚∏ª‚∏ª‚∏ª‚∏ª‚∏ª‚∏ª‚∏ª‚∏ª‚∏ª‚∏ª‚∏ª‚∏ª‚∏ª‚∏ª‚∏ª‚∏ª

4. Smart Room

Implement a type representing a room that contains an array of smart devices. It should provide:
	‚Ä¢	A constructor that accepts an array of devices.
	‚Ä¢	Methods to:
	‚Ä¢	Get a reference to a device by index.
	‚Ä¢	Get a mutable reference to a device by index.
	‚Ä¢	Print a status report of all devices in the room.

‚∏ª‚∏ª‚∏ª‚∏ª‚∏ª‚∏ª‚∏ª‚∏ª‚∏ª‚∏ª‚∏ª‚∏ª‚∏ª‚∏ª‚∏ª‚∏ª‚∏ª‚∏ª

5. Smart Home

Implement a type representing a smart home, which contains an array of rooms. It should provide:
	‚Ä¢	A constructor that accepts an array of rooms.
	‚Ä¢	Methods to:
	‚Ä¢	Get a reference to a room by index.
	‚Ä¢	Get a mutable reference to a room by index.
	‚Ä¢	Print a status report of all rooms.

You can choose arbitrary array sizes.
If an index is out of bounds, the application must terminate with a panic!().

### üîß Example Binary Requirements

Implemented as a bin crate.
	‚Ä¢	Create an instance of the smart home and print a full report of its contents.
	‚Ä¢	Modify the home: turn off a smart outlet in one of the rooms.
	‚Ä¢	Print the report again.

‚∏ª‚∏ª‚∏ª‚∏ª‚∏ª‚∏ª‚∏ª‚∏ª‚∏ª‚∏ª‚∏ª‚∏ª‚∏ª‚∏ª‚∏ª‚∏ª‚∏ª‚∏ª

### ‚úÖ Evaluation Criteria
	‚Ä¢	The package builds successfully with cargo build.
	‚Ä¢	The binary example runs successfully and prints the smart home report.
	‚Ä¢	Commands cargo clippy and cargo fmt --check return with no warnings or errors.
	‚Ä¢	Unit tests are present and pass successfully.
